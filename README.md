The excess crops cultivated by farmers lead to a huge wastage of food, which in turn reduces the farmers profits and increase the wastage of energy, resources and lead to several types of pollution.

Application aims to minimize the wastage of cultivated crops by creating a medium for farmers throughout the island to communicate with each other as well as connect them with wholesalers and retailers. By making information such as the type of crop, land area etc. farmers can coordinate the type of crops each other grows so that the same crop is not excessively cultivated.
